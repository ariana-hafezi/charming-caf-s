# My Personal Project

## *Introduction*

I intended to design an application that allows the user to log coffee shops they have visited.
The application will allow you to create a list of coffee shops, and record information about them such as ambience, 
volume, and amount of seating. In addition, users will be able to list the drinks or food they've tried at each 
coffee shop. These can be rated and potentially tagged with information such as their season, sweetness, flavour, 
etc. If possible, I intend to allow users to view lists of drinks/food from their logged coffee shops based on tags,
and sort them by rating. In addition, I'd like to include a feature where coffee shops can be given a score based
on the average rating of their items, and then ranked. If possible, users will also be to mark coffee shops or 
items at them as wishlist items, which they have not tried yet but would like to.

This application could be used by a wide variety of people. It could be particularly helpful for students, as 
maintaining a list of coffee shops that could double as study spaces would be convenient.

This project is of interest to me as I particularly enjoy trying a variety of drinks at different coffee shops,
and comparing them to similar drinks at other ones. I also enjoy discovering new cafes, and would love to have
a charming app where I could keep a detailed record of them.
