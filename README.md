# Personal Project: *Charming Cafés*

## Introduction

I intended to design an application that allows the user to log cafés they have visited.
The application will allow you to create a list of coffee shops, and record information about them such as ambience, 
volume, and amount of seating. In addition, users will be able to list the drinks or food they've tried at each 
coffee shop. These can be rated and potentially tagged with information such as their season, sweetness, flavour, 
etc. If possible, I intend to allow users to view filter lists of drinks/food from their logged coffee shops
depending on whether they have certain qualities (eg. winter drinks). In addition, I'd like to include a feature 
where cafés can be given a score based on the average rating of their items, and then ranked. 

This application could be used by a wide variety of people. It could be particularly helpful for students, as 
maintaining a list of coffee shops that could double as study spaces would be convenient.

This project is of interest to me as I particularly enjoy trying a variety of drinks at different coffee shops,
and comparing them to similar drinks at other ones. I also enjoy discovering new cafes, and would love to have
a charming app where I could keep a detailed record of them.
